You will have to run the application in a local environment.
Use github to clone the repository on your local computer. git clone (repository url)
After the clone has been put on your computer location, go into the directory of the project and activate virtual environent.
You can use py -m venv path\to\new\virtual\environmnet to create a virtual environment. (It is already created in this project).
Activate the virtual environment by running this line of code path/to/venv/Scripts/activate.bat
When the virtual environment is up and running, use pip to install the requirements.txt file since it contains all the dependacies for the project to work.
pip install -r requirements.txt
After the requirments are done installing you can go ahead and run the server using py manage.py runserver.
This will allow you to have access to the website and test the functionality of the website
